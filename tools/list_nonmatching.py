"""List remaining nonmatching functions sorted by size.

Discovery is by path: every ``.s`` under a ``nonmatchings/`` directory is one
unmatched function, and the filename is its name. That is the whole backlog --
splat writes exactly one glabel per file, and every stub in ``src`` resolves to
one of these. With ``--include-matched`` the already-decompiled functions under
``matchings/`` are listed too, so you can see a whole object's shape at once.

Do NOT go back to trusting the first line of the file. A function that owns a
jump table has its ``.rodata`` emitted *ahead* of the ``.text``, so the file
opens with the jtbl's header instead of the function's; keying discovery off
that header silently dropped all 136 such functions -- i.e. exactly the jtbl
cases, which are the expensive ones.

The header is still read, but only for the size, and only as a hint: we look for
the ``nonmatching <name>, 0xSIZE`` line belonging to the file's own symbol
anywhere in the file, and fall back to counting instructions when it is absent.
Handwritten functions (splat prepends ``/* Handwritten function */``) are
flagged but still listed.

To work on one object, ``--object <name>`` scopes the listing to that splat
object and sorts by address. Add ``--include-matched`` and you get the layout of
the original .c file: every function, matched and not, in source order.
``--by-object`` is the index for finding the name.

A reachability column labels statically-orphaned functions: ``dead`` means
nothing references the function by any vector -- jal/%lo/%hi/.word in split
asm, raw address words in the built images, or jal-encoded words in excess of
the split-asm jal count (calls from UNSPLIT regions; this last vector is what
proved the 2026-08 world "dead islands" false). ``unreachable`` means it has
referrers, but every reference chain starts at dead code. Liveness propagates
from data-referenced functions, entry seeds (--seed to extend) and
unsplit-region callers. Caveat: disc-streamed dispatch words are invisible, so
both labels mean *statically* dead. ``--no-deep`` skips the binary scans
(build/ images required), ``--no-reach`` skips the analysis entirely.
